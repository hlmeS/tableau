## Visual Analytics

+++
### Visual Analytics is ...



“... an iterative and interactive
approach to analytical reasoning.”

“... used to create interactive,
easy-to-use dashboards,
that show most import information
at a single glance.”

+++
### Approaches to Visual Analytics



1. Exploring data by **creating visualization first** and then interpreting them (_e.g. sales seasonalities_)


2. **Asking questions first**, and then finding the right visualization to answer the question (_e.g. when and where are my sales the highest?_ )

+++

### Outcomes ...


... are typically presented in the form of:

* Dashboards
* Stories
* Reports
* Combination of the above


---

## Dashboards

+++

### Dashboards are ...



" ... visual display of the most **important information** needed to achieve** one or more objectives**;
consolidated and arranged on a **single screen** so the information can be **monitored at a glance**.”

+++

### Design Principles

* Choose metrics based on why they matter
* Keep it visual
* Make it interactive
* Keep it current or don’t bother
* Make it simple to access and use
