## Visual Analytics

+++
### Visual Analytics is ...

“... an iterative and interactive
approach to analytical reasoning.”

“... used to create interactive,
easy-to-use dashboards,
that show most import information
at a single glance.”

+++
### Approaches to Visual Analytics

1. Exploring data by **creating visualization first** and then interpreting them (_e.g. sales seasonalities_)


2. **Asking questions first**, and then finding the right visualization to answer the question (_e.g. when and where are my sales the highest?_ )
